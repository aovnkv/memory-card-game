## Instructions

The game's goal is to match all the cards on a deck as quick and minimum clicks as possible.  
So every card has a pair/copy to match.  
Cards are randomly distrbuted on the deck after every page load and/or game restart.  
The game starts after the first card click on the deck.  
Player can restart the game any time by clicking &#10227;  
Good luck!
